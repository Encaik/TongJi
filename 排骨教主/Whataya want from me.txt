Hey, slow it down
What do you want from me
What do you want from me
Yeah, I'm afraid
What do you want from me
What do you from me

There might have been a time
I would give myself away
Ooh once upon a time
I didn't give a damn
But now here we are
So what do you want from me
What do you want from me

Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up,
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, what do you want from me
What do you want from me
What do you want from me

Yeah, it's plain to see
That baby you're beautiful
And it's nothing wrong with you
It's me â€“ I'm a freak
But thanks for lovin' me
Cause you're doing it perfectly

Yeah there might have been a time
When I would let you step away
I wouldn't even try but I think
You could save my life

Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up,
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, what do you want from me
What do you want from me
What do you want from me

Just don't give up on me

I won't let you down

No, I won't let you down

So ..
Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up,
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, what do you want from me
Just don't give up
I'm workin' it out
Please don't give in
I won't let you down
It messed me up,
Need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, whataya want from me
