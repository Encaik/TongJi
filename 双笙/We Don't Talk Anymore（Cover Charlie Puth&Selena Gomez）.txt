双笙：We don't talk anymore
囧菌：We don't talk anymore
合：We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
囧菌：We don't love anymore
双笙：What was all of it for
合：Oh we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
囧菌：I just heard you found the one you've been lookin'
You've been lookin' for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
Cuz even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
双笙：Don't wanna know
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
囧菌：I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh it's such a shame
We don't talk anymore
双笙：We don't talk anymore
合：We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
双笙：We don't love anymore
囧菌：What was all of it for
合：Oh we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
双笙：I just hope you're lyin' next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
囧菌：Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
双笙：I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh it's such a shame
合：We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for
Oh we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
囧菌：Like we used to do
双笙：Don't wanna know
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's givin' it to you just right
The way I did before
囧菌：I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
合：Oh it's such a shame
We don't talk anymore
