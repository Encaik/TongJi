Hey,hey my girl,listen to me.
May I be your close friend?
Without hesitation , just tell me
I just wanna see and wanna hear
Play the guitar wanna wait and see
I wish I can win Your smile and your heart
Sing the same song togehter under the linder tree
I look into your eyes
Those lollipops are so sweet
Two dimples are so charming
Lovely girl, my heart beats
Like an innocent angel from the heaven
Sprinkle the sunshine right on me
Somethings are truly meant to be
Give me your phone number
Just drop me a small cute hint
I practice it day and night
Ring you some day , say my love
And if you love me , don’t stop to think
Follow this pace, just sing as I sing
Music says what I wanna say
So many years ago ,
The fairy tales are old
The Legends changed a lot
But those true loves still glow
With our hearts and soul
Let our love to make a whole new world
We can paint a rainbow as we all grow
So many years ago ,
The fairy tales are old
The Legends changed a lot
But those true loves still glow
With our hearts and soul
Let our love to make a whole new world
We can paint a rainbow as we all grow
Love is my only word
