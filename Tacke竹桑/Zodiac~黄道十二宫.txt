To get me out , out of crowded universe,
Universe just got to burst,
Burst into embers.
Havoc has recurred.
If I’m not ,I’m not born with wings and horns,
To trek in nights and leap the thorns,
Who will show up in the dawn?
If I’m not ,I’m not armed with shields and spears,
To kill thousands with no fear
Who ll be proudly cheered?
Pisces, slaked in the skyline,
Were you still waiting, waiting for next time?
To pick me out, out of 12 in 88,
88 lost epic tales,
Tales about sun rays.
But only 12 could flame.
Am I a vagrant, or holy infant?
Living in my palace, in the nebulae.
Near the equator, by the ecliptic,
Star charts are repainted.
There, the totems are arrayed,
Directly cross the milky way.
If I’m not ,I’m not wearing masks of ghost,
Half vampire, and half angel,
Am I fallen, who will know?
If I’m not, I’m not endowed charming look,
Too glamorous to endure.
who will be seduced?
Aries, rose in the midnight,
Were you still waiting, waiting for last time?
Get me out , out of crowded universe,
Universe just got to burst,
Burst into embers.
So havoc has recurred.
Pick me out, out of 12 in 88,
88 lost epic tales,
Tales about sun rays.
But only 12 could flame.
because I don t have one more life
For myself to divine.
Pick me out, out of 12 in 88,
88 lost epic names,
Names are doomed to fade.
But only I remained.
